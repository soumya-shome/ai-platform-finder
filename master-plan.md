# AI Platform Discovery App - Master Plan

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ App Overview & Objectives
The AI Platform Discovery App is designed to help users find the perfect AI platform based on their needs. Using an **LLM-powered natural language search**, users can describe their requirements in plain English and receive ranked results. The app will feature **a dynamic tagging system**, **ratings & reviews**, and a **comparison tool**, ensuring an intuitive and efficient discovery experience.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Target Audience
- **Developers** looking for AI tools with APIs and integrations
- **Businesses** searching for AI solutions for operations
- **General users** exploring AI platforms for personal use

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Features & Functionality
- **AI Platform Directory**: A comprehensive list of AI tools with details like features, pricing, and API availability.
- **LLM-Integrated Search**: Users can describe their needs in natural language, and the AI will return ranked results.
- **Dynamic Tagging System**: AI platforms can have multiple relevant tags instead of being locked into predefined categories.
- **Comparison Tool**: Users can select multiple platforms and compare their specifications side by side.
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Users can rate AI platforms and leave feedback.
- **Community Flagging + Manual Moderation**: Users can report spam or inappropriate content, which will be reviewed manually.
- **No Sign-in Required**: Users can interact with the platform without creating an account.
- **Data Collection**: A mix of **automated scraping** (for initial population) and **user submissions** (for updates and new entries).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js (for a fast and scalable web app)
- **Backend & Database**: Firebase (NoSQL for flexible and scalable data storage)
- **Search Engine**: LLM integration for natural language processing
- **Data Scraping**: Automated scraping tools to collect AI platform details
- **Moderation System**: Community flagging + manual review queue

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conceptual Data Model
- **AI Platforms** (Name, Description, Features, Pricing, API Availability, Tags, Ratings)
- **Tags** (Dynamically assigned to AI platforms)
- **Reviews** (User Ratings, Comments, Flag Status)
- **Comparison List** (Temporary data storage for side-by-side comparisons)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ User Interface Design Principles
- **Simple & Intuitive**: Clean UI with an easy-to-use search bar
- **Minimalist Design**: Focus on search results with clear, digestible information
- **Responsive**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsing
- **User-Friendly Comparisons**: Well-structured side-by-side comparisons

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Moderation Considerations
- **Community flagging system** for reporting spam or misleading reviews
- **Manual moderation queue** for approving or removing flagged content
- **Rate-limiting & CAPTCHA** to prevent spam submissions

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Development Phases & Milestones
### Phase 1: MVP Development (3-4 Months)
